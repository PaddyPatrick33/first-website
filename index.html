            One thing most people ask about when talking about a pc is what graphics card you have, depending on what they say will determine how good of a pc is really is.
            There are many brands of Graphics cards, the one in the build is a ASUS TUF Gaming 3080. While this GC is getting older it still preforms wonderfully for every game out there.
